## `[62]` Grey Relational Meta-Analysis: A Robust Pooling Method with Redescending Effect Guard

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Bias reduction (percent)  
**Data:** 4,572 Cochrane meta-analyses (Pairwise70), 2,000-rep simulation

### 156-word body

Can grey relational analysis provide a transparent and robust alternative to inverse-variance meta-analytic pooling? GRMA was evaluated via simulation with 2,000 replicates across 25 scenarios against four comparators and benchmarked on 4,572 real Cochrane meta-analyses from the Pairwise70 dataset. The method represents each study in a two-feature space of effect size and log-precision, computing grey relational coefficients with an explicit Tukey bisquare redescending effect guard and bootstrap percentile interval inference. GRMA reduced median absolute bias of the pooled RR by up to 66 percent in four of five outlier scenarios, with bootstrap 95% CI coverage of 0.940. In the Pairwise70 benchmark, GRMA estimates correlated at r equals 0.956 with standard random-effects estimates, increasing to 0.980 at k of at least 10. GRMA offers a transparent companion to standard random-effects models for detecting and down-weighting influential outliers in routine synthesis. However, a limitation is that statistical power under uncontaminated conditions was 13 percentage points lower than HKSJ.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
